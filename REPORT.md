This definitely was a good learning experience for me.

I didn't come across difficulties that hindered me entirely, most of the problems I encountered, I realized that if I just take a break, step back, relax and come back to it later, I'd usually come up with a solution.

The biggest problem I encountered was, mapping sample email's data into individual email rows. Mapping method (.map) isn't a new thing to me, however at first I was puzzled with mapping react components by array data. Nevertheless in hindsight, it was more of an experience problem, and I eventually overcame it by trial-and-error, tinkering here-and-there.
